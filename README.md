# SignForge Player - Integrated with SignForge Digital Signage API

The SignForge Player is designed for digital signage players like BrightSign and has now been integrated with the SignForge Digital Signage API. Built using TypeScript and CSS animations, it is ideal for placement behind or above the counter at a C-Store. The player is capable of updating promotions and calls-to-action using APIs. The goal of this project was to match my animation skills in After Effects with CSS. The SignForge CMS is coming soon.

## Features

- Integration with the SignForge Digital Signage API
- Customizable promotions and calls-to-action
- Eye-catching CSS animations and transitions
- Playlist updates after every playthrough
- Built with TypeScript

## How It Works

The SignForge Player is built using TypeScript and CSS animations, which can be customized to match a brand's aesthetics. It is designed to be run on a digital signage player like BrightSign, which can be placed behind the counter at a C-Store. Using the SignForge Digital Signage API, the player can be updated with promotions, calls-to-action, and other relevant information.

## Optimizations

- Update Screen compatibility: Currently, the project is optimized to run on a digital signage screen with a resolution of 1920x1080. Plans are in place to update the CSS to accommodate more resolutions and sizes, such as 3840x2160.
- Build a management tool with a backend to manage each sign and update the promotion schedule.

## What I Learned

During this project, I improved my CSS skills by focusing on CSS animations. I explored advanced animation techniques and aimed to match my digital signage and animation background. Additionally, I learned about optimizing for specific browser features and how Chrome renders and refreshes the page. The project also provided an opportunity to rebuild the player with TypeScript and implement playlist updates after each playthrough.
