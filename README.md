# Dynamic Digital Signage Ad

The Dynamic Digital Signage Ad is designed for digital signage players like BrightSign. Built using JavaScript and CSS animations, it is designed to be placed behind the counter at a C-Store, and can be updated with promotions and calls-to-action using APIs.

## Features

- Customizable promotions and calls-to-action
- Eye-catching CSS animations and transitions
- Updates through APIs

## How It Works

The ad is built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS animations, which can be customized to match a brand's aesthetics. It is designed to be run on a digital signage player like BrightSign, which can be placed behind the counter at a C-Store. Using APIs, the ad can be updated with promotions, calls-to-action, and other relevant information.

## Optimizations

- Update Screen compatibility: Currently, the project is optimized to run on a digital signage screen with a resolution of 1920X1080. I would like to update the CSS to accommodate more resolutions and sizes, such as 3840x2160.
- Build a management tool with a backend to manage each sign and update the promotion schedule.

## What I Learned

During this project, I improved my CSS skills by focusing on CSS animations. I explored advanced animation techniques and aimed to match my digital signage and animation background. Additionally, I learned about optimizing for specific browser features and how Chrome renders and refreshes the page.
